                <p class="paragraph">
                    Movies are more than just a form of entertainment – they reflect the cultural, social, and
                    technological shifts of their time. The genres we see on the big screen are no different. Over the
                    decades, movie genres have evolved, shifting in response to the world around them. At Pop Culture
                    Data Dive, we explore how the most popular movie genres have changed, reflecting the tastes and
                    trends of each era, from the golden age of Hollywood to the modern blockbuster era. </p>

                        Behind the Lens – The Rise of Female in a Male Dominated Field
                    </h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The camera doesn’t lie, but the stories behind who gets to call the shots do. For decades,
                        Hollywood has been dominated by male directors, but women have been making their mark on the big
                        screen. In this section, we dive deep into the numbers behind female versus male directors over
                        the years, examining how the industry has changed and the progress that’s still being made. From
                        the rise of iconic female directors like Kathryn Bigelow to the gender divide still prevalent in
                        the film industry, we provide a comprehensive look at the evolving roles of directors and the
                        future of gender inclusivity in filmmaking.
                    </p>
                    <h5> Until 1990, men occupied, in average, more than 96% of Director's
                        chair, while woman occupied less than 4%.</h5>

                    </div>

                    <h5 style="text-align: center;"> Despite this increase, the film industry remains far from achieving
                        gender parity among directors. Efforts must continue to promote inclusivity and support for
                        female filmmakers. </h5>

                        What happens when a movie franchise is so successful that it becomes a cultural institution?

                        the most successful film franchises in history. Marvel, Star Wars, and Harry Potter – just to

                        fanbases. Through a data-driven lens, we take a deep dive into the numbers behind these
                        cinematic juggernauts. Which franchise has made the most? Which one earns more per film? The
                        answers are here, and they reveal just how much of an impact these franchises have had on both
